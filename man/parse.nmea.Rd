\title{Parse NMEA sentences}
\usage{
parse.nmea(nmea, sentence = NULL, returnAll = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nmea}{A data frame with CPU time and corresponding NMEA sentences
as returned by \code{get_NME0}.}

\item{sentence}{A string identifying the NMEA sentence to process. It
can be one of "GPRMC", "GPGGA", "INGGA", or "GPGLL".}

\item{returnAll}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, all data found in the selected
sentence is returned.}
}
\value{
A data frame with cpu time, gps time (includes miliseconds if found),
longitude, and latitude. Additionally, vessel speed and bearing are returned 
if found in the data.
}
\description{
Find and parse GPS data from NMEA sentences.
}
\details{
This function looks first for the "GPRMC" sentence, if not found  
it tries then with "GPGGA", "INGGA", or "GPGLL", and process the one with
more information (more GPS fixes). Be aware that sometimes strings may be
corrupted, in which case, it is possible to choose manually the sentence 
to process. This is why \code{get_NME0} does not automatically parse the 
NMEA strings by default. 
When one of "GPVTG", "INVTG", "GNVTG", or "IIVTG" sentences is found, vessel 
speed and bearing are also parsed and returned. 
Differences in time.cpu and time.gps may reveal wrong clock settings in the 
data aquisition computer.
