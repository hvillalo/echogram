\title{Read raw files from Simrad EK60 scientific echosounders}
\usage{
read.EK60_raw(file, parseNMEA = FALSE, angles = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{EK60 raw file name.}

\item{parseNMEA}{logical. When false (the default) all the nmea sentences found 
in the raw file are returned as text strings. If \code{TRUE}, the \code{parse.nmea} 
function tries to parse the most appropriate nmea sentence(s) type(s).}

\item{angles}{logical. If \code{TRUE} and angle data is present, a four dimensions array
[depth samples, pings, transceivers, anlges] containing alongship and atwarthship 
electrical angles is also returned.}
}
\value{
A three elements list: (1) configuration, with Header and Transceiver(s) 
        information; (2) nmea sentences (full or parsed); and (3) pings data, 
        which includes at least a sample data table, and received power in a 
        three dimensions array [depth samples, pings, transceivers]. 
        When \code{angles = TRUE}, alongship and athwartship electrical angles 
        are also returned as an array with an extra dimension.
}
\description{
This function imports all data in EK60 raw files.
}
\details{
This function imports the file as raw bytes with \code{read.EK_raw}. 
Then, the configuration information is obtained from datagram CON0 with 
\code{get_CON0}, nmea sentences (NME0) with \code{get_NME0}, and finally  
acoustic data in RAW0 datagrams with \code{get_RAW0}.
}

if(interactive()){
ekraw <- read.EK60_raw("D20130504-T083828.raw", parseNMEA = TRUE, angles = TRUE)

# Header
ekraw$config$Header

# Transceivers
ekraw$config$Transceiver

# GPS data
