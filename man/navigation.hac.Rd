\title{
 Compute bearing, navigated distance and speed
}
\description{
 This function computes navigation course (bearing), navigated distance, time diference and navigation speed between GPS fixes in position data imported from an HAC file.
}
\usage{
navigation.hac(pos)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pos}{ geographic position data from an HAC file, as imported with \code{position.hac}. }
}
\details{
 The bearing and navigated distance are computed with functions  \code{bearingRhumb} and \code{distVincentyEllipsoid}  from package \code{geosphere}. This function is intended to be called inside \code{read.echogram}, rather than being used directly.
}
\value{
 A data frame with seven variables:
 \item{time.cpu}{date and time from the computer CPU during data acquisition.}
 \item{lon}{longitudes.}
 \item{lat}{latitudes.}
 \item{bearing}{navigation course between two consecutive GPS fixes.}
 \item{navdist}{navigated distance between two consecutive GPS fixes.}
 \item{time.dif}{time difference between two consecutive GPS fixes.}
 \item{navspeed}{navigation speed between two consecutive GPS fixes.}
