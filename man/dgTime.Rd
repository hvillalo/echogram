\title{Get datagram time from imported EK* raw files}
\usage{
dgTime(raw, ini)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw}{A raw vector imported via \code{read.EK_raw}.}

\item{ini}{Initial byte with time data.}
}
\value{
datagram time in POSIXct format.
}
\description{
Extract datagram time and convert it to POSIXct.
}
\details{
The cpu time is stored in the first 8 bytes of every datagram, 
after its name. It is assumed that the time zone is UTC, which may not
be the case. By comparig with gps time in nmea data, a correction may 
be applied if needed. The index (ini) comes from output of \code{get_dgIdx} 
function. This function should not be called directly by the user.
