read.EK_raw(file)

A vector of class ``raw''.
}
\description{
This function imports Simrad EK60 or EK80 raw files as raw bytes.
}
\details{
This function will return raw bytes as hex digits, therefore is not   
intended to be called directly by the user. Instead, \code{read.EK_raw} is 
called by other echogram's functions that also convert the various datagrams
in EK60 files to their appropriate type.
